//Countdown to Destruction

//Your computer has just been infected (Sorry)
//The virus was designed to corrupt 4 gigabytes of the data on your computer each hour.
//Depending on how big your hard drive is, this could happen slowly over a period of time or very quickly.
//The problem is that you just blindly picked a hard drive without paying attention to it's capacity,
//and will have to randomly find out how much space you have. Fortunately, you can determine the minimum
//and maximum capacity.
